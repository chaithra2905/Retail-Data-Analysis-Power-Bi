Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Imported the data sets: Sales_Data_Ecommerce and Promotions.
Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
Integrated the two data sets based on common fields (e.g., product_id) to enrich the analysis.
Derived Variables:

Created additional variables to aid in the analysis, such as:
Revenue: Calculated as price multiplied by the number of purchased events.
Potential Revenue: Estimated revenue based on cart events.
